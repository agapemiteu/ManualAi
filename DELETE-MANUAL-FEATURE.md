## How It Works

### Backend API (Already Exists)
```
DELETE /api/manuals/{manual_id}
- Deletes the manual from storage
- Removes vector store
- Returns 204 No Content on success
- Returns 404 if manual not found
- Returns 409 if manual is processing (unless force=true)
```

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Fetch All Manuals
```typescript
const fetchUploadedManuals = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/manuals`);
  const data = await response.json();
  setUploadedManuals(data.manuals || []);
};
```

#### 2. Delete Manual with Confirmation
```typescript
const deleteUploadedManual = async (manual_id: string) => {
  if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this manual?')) {
    return;
  }
  
  await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/manuals/${manual_id}`, { 
    method: 'DELETE' 
  });
  
  // Refresh list
  await fetchUploadedManuals();
};
```

#### 3. UI Component
```tsx
<div className="rounded-2xl border bg-slate-950/60 p-6">
  <h2>My Uploaded Manuals</h2>
  {uploadedManuals.map(manual => (
    <div key={manual.manual_id}>
      <div>
        <p>{manual.filename}</p>
        <p>{manual.brand} {manual.model} {manual.year}</p>
        <span className={statusClass}>{manual.status}</span>
      </div>
      <button onClick={() => deleteUploadedManual(manual.manual_id)}>
        <Trash2 /> Delete
      </button>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```
