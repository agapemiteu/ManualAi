# ‚úÖ FINAL SOLUTION: Delete Persistent Storage & Use /tmp

## What We Fixed

‚úÖ **Moved ALL storage to `/tmp`**
- No more persistent volume cache issues
- No more `.pyc` file problems
- Everything uses `/tmp/manualai/*` (always writable, always fresh)

‚úÖ **Updated paths:**
- Uploads: `/tmp/manualai/uploads`
- Vector store: `/tmp/manualai/manual_store`
- OCR cache: `/tmp/ocr_cache`
- HuggingFace cache: `/tmp/manualai/hf_cache`
- Matplotlib: `/tmp/matplotlib`

‚úÖ **Code changes deployed:**
- main.py: Uses /tmp paths
- document_loader.py: Lazy OCR cache initialization
- Dockerfile: All caches point to /tmp
- start.sh: Ensures directories exist

## üî• CRITICAL STEP: Delete Persistent Storage

**YOU MUST DO THIS NOW:**

1. **Go to:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/agapemiteu/ManualAi/settings

2. **Scroll down** to find one of these sections:
   - "Storage"
   - "Persistent Storage"
   - "Factory Reboot"

3. **Click the button:**
   - "Delete storage" or
   - "Factory reboot" or
   - "Remove persistent storage"

4. **Confirm** the deletion

5. **Wait** for Space to rebuild (~2-3 minutes)

## After Deletion

The Space will rebuild with:
- ‚úÖ Fresh code (no cached `.pyc` files)
- ‚úÖ All storage in `/tmp` (no permission errors)
- ‚úÖ OCR disabled (`MANUAL_DISABLE_OCR=true`)
- ‚úÖ 120s timeout protection
- ‚úÖ Force delete capability

## Testing

Once the Space is rebuilt:

```powershell
# 1. Wait for rebuild
python wait_for_rebuild.py

# 2. Test upload
python test_upload.py

# 3. Or test via frontend
# Go to: https://manual-ai-psi.vercel.app/upload
# Upload a PDF manual
# Should complete in ~30 seconds
```

## Why This Works

**Before:**
- `/data` persistent volume had old `.pyc` files
- Python loaded cached bytecode instead of source
- No amount of rebuilding cleared the cache

**After:**
- `/tmp` is ephemeral (cleared on every restart)
- No `.pyc` cache survives restarts
- Every deployment gets fresh code
- No persistent volume = no cache issues

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed to work
- ‚úÖ No cache issues ever
- ‚úÖ Fast restarts with fresh code
- ‚úÖ No permission problems

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uploaded manuals are lost on restart
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Users need to re-upload after Space sleeps/restarts

**Solution for persistence:**
- Use external storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
- Or accept ephemeral storage for free tier
- Or upgrade to persistent storage tier (but current cache issue shows it's problematic)

## What Happens on Restart

When HuggingFace Space restarts (sleep, redeploy, etc.):
1. `/tmp` is wiped clean ‚úÖ
2. Fresh code loads ‚úÖ
3. Directories are recreated ‚úÖ
4. Users upload new manuals ‚úÖ

For a production app, you'd want external storage, but for testing/development, `/tmp` is perfect.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Delete persistent storage** (you need to do this)
2. ‚úÖ Wait for rebuild
3. ‚úÖ Test upload
4. ‚úÖ Celebrate! üéâ

Once it works, we can add external storage if needed.
