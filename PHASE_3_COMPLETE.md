4. Push to HF
5. Wait for build (~10 min)
6. Test live demo!

### 3. Update README with Live Link (2 minutes)

After deployment, update `README.md`:

```markdown
[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚀_Live_Demo-HuggingFace-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/ManualAi)
```

### 4. Share Your Work! (10 minutes)

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
🚀 Excited to share my latest project: ManualAi!

An intelligent car manual Q&A system that achieves 64% accuracy 
(±2 pages) on a 608-page manual - that's an 800% improvement 
over keyword search baseline!

Key achievements:
✅ Hybrid semantic + keyword search
✅ Systematic experimentation (11 iterations)
✅ Beautiful visualizations
✅ Live demo on HuggingFace Spaces
✅ Production-ready architecture

Tech stack: Python, Transformers, ChromaDB, Gradio

## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

### 1. Results (30 seconds)
"I built an intelligent car manual Q&A system that improved accuracy from 8% to 64% - an 800% increase - through systematic experimentation with 11 different configurations."

### 2. Technical Approach (1 minute)
"I implemented a hybrid RAG system combining semantic search (70%) with keyword search (30%), using cross-encoder reranking and exponential voting. The architecture includes query expansion, context-aware retrieval, and page-aware boosting."

### 3. Key Learning (30 seconds)
"Most interesting was discovering over-optimization - adding too many 'smart' features actually reduced accuracy from 64% to 52%. Simple, well-tuned solutions beat complex ones."

### 4. Production Ready (30 seconds)
"The system is deployed on HuggingFace Spaces with a Gradio interface, properly documented, and production-ready. It processes queries in ~16 seconds with comprehensive error handling."
