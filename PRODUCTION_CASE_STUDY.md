### 2.2 Core Components

#### A. Document Processing
- **PDF Parser**: PyMuPDF (fitz) - text-only extraction
- **Chunking Strategy**: 
  - Chunk size: 800 characters
  - Overlap: 150 characters
  - Preserves context across boundaries

**Design decision**: Originally planned to use `unstructured` library with OCR support, but encountered deployment issues (NLTK permissions on HuggingFace). Switched to PyMuPDF-only approach, which surprisingly **improved accuracy**.

<!-- YOUR INSIGHT: What did you learn about trade-offs between complexity and performance? -->

#### B. Retrieval System
- **Embeddings**: `all-mpnet-base-v2` (768 dimensions)
  - Pretrained on 1B+ sentence pairs
  - Balanced accuracy/speed trade-off
  
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB (in-memory)
  - HNSW index for fast similarity search
  - Cosine similarity metric

- **Retrieval Parameters**:
  - Initial retrieval: Top 60 candidates
  - Query expansion: 3 variations per question
  - Final selection: Top 7 documents
  - Deduplication based on content similarity

#### C. Answer Generation
- **LLM**: Groq API with Llama 3.1-8b-instant
  - Temperature: 0.3 (focused responses)
  - Max tokens: 250
  - Fallback: Rule-based synthesis if LLM unavailable

---

## 3. Evaluation Methodology

### 3.1 Test Dataset

**Ground Truth Creation:**
- Manual: 2023 Toyota 4Runner Owner's Manual (608 pages, 11.8MB)
- Questions: 50 carefully curated Q&A pairs
- Categories:
  - Safety & Critical Operations (8 questions)
  - Troubleshooting & Emergency (8 questions)
  - Maintenance & How-To (9 questions)
  - System Knowledge (8 questions)
  - Advanced Systems (6 questions)
  - Miscellaneous (11 questions)

**Quality criteria for ground truth:**
1. Questions must be answerable from the manual
2. Answer location clearly identified (page number)
3. Questions span different difficulty levels
4. Cover both common and edge-case scenarios

<!-- YOUR NOTE: Describe your process for creating these questions -->

### 3.2 Accuracy Metrics

**Tolerance levels** (accounting for multi-page answers):
- **Exact match (±0 pages)**: Retrieved page = ground truth page
- **Within ±2 pages**: Standard metric for RAG systems
- **Within ±5 pages**: Lenient metric (still useful for navigation)
- **Within ±10 pages**: Very lenient (diagnostic purposes)

**Why ±2 pages matters:**
Many manual topics span multiple pages. A retrieval that's 1-2 pages off still provides the user with relevant context and allows quick navigation to the exact answer.

<!-- YOUR REFLECTION: Why did you choose these specific tolerance levels? -->

### 3.3 Test Environment

**Production deployment tested:**
- API Endpoint: `https://agapemiteu-manualai.hf.space`
- Manual uploaded: 2023 Toyota 4Runner (full 608 pages)
- Processing time: 65 seconds
- Test execution: Sequential queries with 1-second delay (rate limiting)

---

## 4. Results & Analysis

### 4.1 Accuracy Performance

| Tolerance Level | Questions Correct | Percentage | Status |
|----------------|-------------------|------------|---------|
| **Exact Match (±0 pages)** | 21 / 50 | **42%** | ✅ Excellent |
| **Within ±2 pages** | 38 / 50 | **76%** | ⭐ Outstanding |
| **Within ±5 pages** | 38 / 50 | **76%** | ✅ Strong |
| **Within ±10 pages** | 39 / 50 | **78%** | ✅ Robust |

**Key Finding**: The system achieved **76% accuracy within ±2 pages**, exceeding the initial 64% target from local evaluation.

### 4.2 Comparison: Research vs Production

| Configuration | Environment | OCR Enabled | Exact Match | ±2 Pages | ±5 Pages |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Research Prototype** | Local machine | ✅ Yes | 32% | 64% | 70% |
| **Production System** | HuggingFace | ❌ No | **42%** ↑ | **76%** ↑ | **76%** ↑ |

**Analysis:**

<!-- YOUR INTERPRETATION: Why do you think production outperformed research? Here's the data to work with: -->

The production system **outperformed** the research prototype despite having **simpler** document processing. Several factors explain this:

1. **Cleaner text extraction**: PyMuPDF directly extracts embedded text, avoiding OCR artifacts
2. **Digital PDF advantage**: The Toyota manual has well-structured embedded text
3. **System maturity**: Production code had additional refinements in retrieval logic
4. **Deployment stability**: Pre-cached models eliminated runtime variability

**Counterintuitive insight**: Removing OCR (due to deployment constraints) actually **improved** accuracy. This suggests that for digital PDFs, text-based extraction is superior to OCR-based approaches.

### 4.3 Performance by Question Category

<!-- I'll provide the detailed breakdown, you can add commentary -->

**Category-wise accuracy** (within ±2 pages):

| Category | Questions | Correct | Accuracy | Notes |

<!-- YOUR REFLECTION: Why split across three platforms? What are the trade-offs? -->

### 5.2 Deployment Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: NLTK Permission Errors**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/nltk_data'
```
- **Root cause**: `unstructured` library hardcodes `/nltk_data` path
- **Solution**: Removed unstructured, used PyMuPDF only
- **Outcome**: Faster processing, better accuracy

**Challenge 2: Model Download at Runtime**
```
PermissionError at /tmp/manualai/hf_cache/models--sentence-transformers
```
- **Root cause**: Multiple instances downloading models simultaneously
- **Solution**: Pre-download models during Docker build
- **Outcome**: Eliminated runtime errors, faster startup

**Challenge 3: Missing Source Pages in API Response**
- **Root cause**: API only returned answer text, no page numbers
- **Solution**: Modified `QueryResponse` model and RAG chain to include `source_pages`
- **Outcome**: Enabled accuracy evaluation, improved user experience

<!-- YOUR LEARNING: What was the most frustrating bug? How did you debug it? -->

## 6. Key Learnings

### 6.1 Technical Insights

**1. Simplicity Can Outperform Complexity**

The production system uses **simpler** document processing than the research prototype, yet achieves **better** results. This demonstrates that:
- Digital PDFs don't benefit from OCR
- Fewer dependencies = more reliable deployment
- Text-based extraction is faster and cleaner

<!-- YOUR TAKE: How does this change your approach to future projects? -->

**2. Deployment Constraints Drive Innovation**

The NLTK permission error forced a rethink of the document processing pipeline. The "downgrade" to PyMuPDF-only actually **improved** the system. Sometimes constraints lead to better solutions.

<!-- YOUR PERSPECTIVE: When has a limitation improved your work? -->

**3. Tolerance Metrics Are Critical**

Exact page match (42%) vs ±2 pages (76%) shows dramatic difference. For RAG systems, defining the right success metric is crucial. In practice, ±2 pages is more useful than exact match since:
- Topics span multiple pages
- Users can quickly scan nearby pages
- Contextual information is preserved

### 6.2 Evaluation Insights

**Ground Truth Quality Matters**

The 50-question evaluation set required careful curation:
- Questions must be unambiguous
- Answers must be clearly in the manual
- Page numbers must be accurate
- Categories should be balanced

<!-- YOUR PROCESS: How did you ensure ground truth quality? -->

**Production Testing Is Essential**

Local evaluation (64% accuracy) did not predict production performance (76% accuracy). Always test in production environment with real deployment constraints.

### 6.3 Deployment Insights

**Free Tier Is Viable**

Despite using free hosting (HuggingFace Spaces, Vercel), the system:
- Handles 11.8MB file uploads
- Processes 608 pages in 65 seconds
- Serves queries with 2-4 second latency
- Maintains high accuracy

**Multi-Platform Approach Works**

Splitting frontend, backend, and documentation across three platforms:
- ✅ Leverages each platform's strengths
- ✅ Enables independent scaling
- ✅ Provides redundancy
- ⚠️ Adds deployment complexity

<!-- YOUR OPINION: Would you use this architecture again? -->

## 7. Limitations & Future Work

### 7.1 Current Limitations

**1. Text-Only PDFs Required**
- No OCR support in production
- Scanned manuals won't work
- Image-heavy pages ignored

**Mitigation**: Add user guidance about PDF requirements

**2. Single Manual at a Time**
- Current system processes one manual per upload
- No multi-manual search
- Manual history not persisted

**Future**: Add persistent storage for manual library

**3. English Language Only**
- Embedding model trained on English
- LLM generates English responses
- No multilingual support

**Future**: Integrate multilingual models (e.g., mBERT)

### 7.2 Accuracy Improvement Opportunities

**24% of questions still missed within ±2 pages:**

Possible improvements:
1. **Hybrid search**: Combine semantic + BM25 keyword search
2. **Query expansion**: Better synonym handling
3. **Reranking**: Add cross-encoder reranking step
4. **Chunk optimization**: Experiment with chunk sizes
5. **Context window**: Retrieve neighboring chunks

<!-- YOUR PRIORITY: Which improvement would you tackle first? Why? -->
