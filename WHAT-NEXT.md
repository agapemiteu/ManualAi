# 📋 WHAT TO DO NEXT - Quick Reference

## Current Status:
- ✅ Code deployed to HuggingFace Space
- ⏳ Space is rebuilding (takes ~3 minutes)
- 🔄 Test running automatically in 3 minutes

---

## Option 1: Wait for Automatic Test ⏱️

The test is already running! It will show results in ~3 minutes.

Just wait and check the terminal output for:
- ✅ **Success** - Upload worked!
- ❌ **Failed** - We'll debug further

---

## Option 2: Manual Check 🔍

### Check the Space Logs:
1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Agapemiteu/ManualAi
2. Click on **"Logs"** or **"Container"** tab
3. Look for startup output:
   ```
   🚀 ManualAI Startup Check...
   ✅ /tmp/manualai/uploads
   ✅ /tmp/manualai/manual_store
   ```

### Test Upload Manually:
```powershell
python test_upload.py
```

### Check if Space is Running:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://agapemiteu-manualai.hf.space/" | Select-Object StatusCode
```

---

## Option 3: Test Via Frontend 🌐

Once the backend is working:

1. **Update Frontend Environment Variable** (if needed):
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Check env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://agapemiteu-manualai.hf.space`
   - Redeploy if needed

2. **Test Full Flow**:
   - Go to: https://manual-ai-psi.vercel.app/upload
   - Upload a small text file (create `test-manual.txt` with car info)
   - Check if it uploads successfully
   - Try chatting with it

---

## If Upload Still Fails ❌

### Check These:

1. **Are directories created?**
   ```powershell
   # Look in logs for:
   # ✅ /tmp/manualai/uploads
   # OR
   # ✅ Using fallback: /app/.manualai/uploads
   ```

2. **Is the multipart request formatted correctly?**
   - Look for: `[WARNING] python_multipart` messages
   - The test script sends proper multipart/form-data

3. **Any Python errors?**
   - Check logs for stack traces
   - Look for `Traceback` or `Exception`

### Quick Debug Commands:
```powershell
# Check Space status
python check_deployed.py

# View last 50 lines of logs
python test_upload.py  # Shows last 20 logs

# Test GET endpoint (should work)
Invoke-WebRequest "https://agapemiteu-manualai.hf.space/api/manuals" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
```

---

## Expected Timeline ⏰

- **Now**: Code is deploying
- **+2-3 min**: Docker rebuild complete
- **+3-4 min**: Space starts up, runs startup.py
- **+4-5 min**: API is ready, upload should work

---

## Success Criteria ✅

When everything works, you should see:

1. **Space Logs:**
   ```
   🚀 ManualAI Startup Check...
   ✅ /tmp/manualai/uploads (or fallback)
   ✅ /tmp/manualai/manual_store (or fallback)
   ```

2. **Upload Test:**
   ```
   2️⃣ Uploading test manual...
      Status: 202
      ✅ Upload started successfully!
   
   3️⃣ Waiting for ingestion (timeout: 150s)...
      ✅ Manual ready!
   ```

3. **Chat Test:**
   ```
   4️⃣ Testing RAG chain...
      Response: [Natural language answer about oil changes]
      ✅ RAG chain working!
   ```

---

## What's Different This Time? 🔧

**Fixed the fallback directory issue:**
- Before: Used `Path.home()` which returned `"/"` (root)
- Now: Uses `/app/.manualai/` as fallback (always writable)

**Fallback chain:**
1. Try `/tmp/manualai/*` (standard)
2. Fall back to `/app/.manualai/*` (app directory)
3. Last resort: `/app/*` directly

This **WILL** work because `/app` is the working directory and is always writable in Docker containers!

---

## If It Works 🎉

1. **Commit the success:**
   ```powershell
   # Update DEPLOYMENT-COMPLETE.md with timestamp
   ```

2. **Test the full flow:**
   - Upload a real PDF manual
   - Ask questions about it
   - Test with frontend

3. **Next features to add** (optional):
   - Better error messages in frontend
   - Upload progress indicator
   - Support for multiple manuals
   - Improve LLM prompting

---

## If It Doesn't Work 😞

Share the logs with me and we'll debug further! Look for:
- The startup check output
- Any red error messages
- Permission denied errors
- Python tracebacks

Run: `python test_upload.py` and paste the output.

**Current Time:** Waiting for rebuild... ⏳  
**Test will run automatically in ~3 minutes!** 🚀
