# 📋 ManualAi Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"ManualAi is an intelligent car manual Q&A system I built that achieves 64% accuracy within 2 pages on a 608-page manual - an 800% improvement over keyword baseline. I systematically tested 11 configurations using hybrid semantic + keyword search with cross-encoder reranking. It's deployed on HuggingFace Spaces with full documentation and visualizations."

- Reranker: ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2

**Config:**
- Chunks: 3000 chars, 30% overlap
- Top-K: 60 → 12 (after reranking)
- Voting: Exponential (3.0^rank)

## 🔬 Experiment Journey

| Phase | Method | Accuracy |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Keyword only | 8% |
| 2 | Semantic only | 26% |
| 3 | Hybrid + rerank | 62% |
| 4 | **Ultimate RAG** | **64%** |

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked ✅
1. Hybrid search (semantic + BM25)
2. Large chunks (3000 chars, 30% overlap)
3. Query expansion (3 variations)
4. Cross-encoder reranking
5. Page-aware boosting

### What Failed ❌
1. Over-optimization (64% → 52%)
2. Multi-stage retrieval
3. Extreme voting parameters
4. Very large chunks (4000+)

### The Learning 🎓
**"Simple, well-tuned solutions beat complex ones."**

## 🎤 Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: "What's your biggest achievement?"
**A:** "Improved accuracy from 8% to 64% through systematic experimentation - that's an 800% improvement. But more importantly, I learned that over-optimization can hurt performance, which taught me when to stop adding complexity."

### Q: "What challenges did you face?"
**A:** "The biggest challenge was hitting a plateau at 64%. After 6 more optimization attempts stayed at 64%, I realized the limitation was in retrieval, not ranking. This taught me to recognize when you're hitting fundamental limits."

### Q: "How did you evaluate success?"
**A:** "I created a 50-question test set with ground-truth page numbers. I measured accuracy at different tolerance levels: exact match (32%), ±2 pages (64%), ±5 pages (70%). The ±2 pages metric balances precision with usability."

### Q: "What would you do differently?"
**A:** "I'd start with better failure analysis earlier. Many of my optimization attempts didn't help because I focused on voting/ranking when the real issue was retrieval quality. Also, I'd implement caching sooner for better latency."

### Q: "How is this production-ready?"
**A:** "It has proper error handling, logging, a clean API, comprehensive documentation, and is deployed on HuggingFace Spaces with a user-friendly interface. The code is modular, testable, and well-documented."
